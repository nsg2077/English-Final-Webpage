      <h3>This I Believe</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This material was our first step into philosophy and it fundamentally focused on the beliefs and viewpoints of others. The unit centered on writing and performing a speech about a belief one held deeply and their insights intowhy one believed that belief. The goal was about understanding others and what leads to beliefs. The exercise was meaningful in multiple contexts. For one, it allowed us to know our new classmates a bit better. Additionally, it led us to understand some world views different from ours. Overall, the unit was an important introductioninto the philosophy of learning others’ points of view and understanding their world views.</p>

      <h3>Inquiry and Multiple Perspectives</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>We studied this unit in the second semester of this philosophy class, but it was extremely helpful for cultivatig an understanding of other viewpoints. The unit focused on independent study of a topic we were interested in. We were tasked with applying critical thinking to a variety of beliefs and analyzing them, connecting them, and synthesizing them. This project was meaningful because our projects were undertaken in a field we were interested in. The unit helped us develop critical thinking with an emphasis on understanding and analyzing viewpoints at an academic.  This experience will be important for our future endeavors in higher education. This unit also helped us understand our own viewpoints more in depth and synthesize a complete viewpoint for ourselves.</p>

      <h3>Morals and Ethics</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I enjoyed this unit because it’s vmorals and ethics are inherent in almost every human interaction, and they explain human actions. One of the activities in this unit was film study. In the main movie we watched, <i>The Cider House Rules</i>, the main character, Homer, had a differing viewpoint on abortion than his mentor, Dr. Larch. However, during the movie, Homer had a personal experience with a friend who needed an abortion. From this experience, he was able to understand Dr. Larch's view on abortion. This movie really encapsulated understanding others’ viewpoints. When it comes down to it, almost everyone has rational reasons for their beliefs and just because someone makes a different decision that another does not necesarily mean either is more right than the other, it means that each person made a fully rational choice at the time. This unit was meaningful because it highlighted how one can not agree with a certain viewpoint but understand the rationality behind it. </p>

      <h3>Life's Journey</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This unit helped in the understanding of others because it focused on patterns that everyone faces in life. From learning about the different phases of the heroic journey, one can understand what another is facing due to what occurred in past stages. For example, if someone had a tough formation period, it is understandable why they may currently have a tough life and many problems. This unit gave unique understanding of the lives of others that is applicable to almost everyone. Additionally, studying the heroic journey on my own, I realized its significance.  The heroic journey shows that the heros of legend are like us, and myths provided role model examples and helped ancient humans understand themselves.

      <h3>Enduring Questions</h3>
        <p>- Can beliefs be formed without experience?</p>
        <p>- How do we know what is the right viewpoint?</p>
        <p>- How do we understand opposing viewpoints?</p>
        <p>- Does knowing one's past give insight to who they are?</p>
